# Document the Hello Workflow in README

**Labels:** `good first issue`, `hello-workflow`, `documentation`

## Description
Update the proj2 README with a "Quick Start" section that summarizes the workflow. Good documentation helps new team members get started quickly.

## Prerequisites
- Issues #1-7 completed (You've gone through the full workflow)

## Tasks
- [ ] Open `proj2/README.md`
- [ ] Add a "Quick Start" section near the top (after the intro, before "Project Structure")
- [ ] Document the 4-step workflow: install prerequisites, install dependencies, run server, verify
- [ ] Include links to the detailed setup sections
- [ ] Review for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Commit and push your changes

## Implementation Guide

Add this section to `proj2/README.md` after the project description and before "Project Structure":

```markdown
## Quick Start

New to the project? Follow these 4 steps to get up and running:

1. **Install Prerequisites** - Install Bun, uv, and Python 3.9+
   - See detailed instructions in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

2. **Install Dependencies** - Install all required packages
   ```bash
   cd proj2
   bun install           # Install root dependencies
   cd frontend && bun install && cd ..   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd backend && uv sync && cd ..        # Install backend dependencies
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server** - Run both frontend and backend
   ```bash
   cd proj2
   bun dev
   ```
   This starts:
   - Backend at http://localhost:8000
   - Frontend at http://localhost:5173

4. **Verify Everything Works** - Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
   - You should see "Hello World" displayed
   - Try the greeting feature to test the full stack

For detailed setup instructions, see [Development Setup](#development-setup) below.

**Having issues?** Check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ README includes a clear Quick Start section
- ✅ All steps are accurate and tested
- ✅ Links to detailed sections work correctly (use markdown heading anchors)
- ✅ Code blocks are properly formatted
- ✅ Section is placed logically in the document flow
- ✅ Grammar and spelling are correct
- ✅ Changes are committed with a descriptive commit message

## Placement

The Quick Start section should be placed here in the README:
```
# proj2
[Existing intro paragraph]

## Quick Start           <-- ADD HERE
[Your new content]

## Project Structure     <-- Existing section
[Existing content]
```

## Testing Your Documentation

1. Read through the Quick Start as if you're a new team member
2. Check that all command examples are correct
3. Verify internal links work by clicking them in GitHub's preview
4. Make sure the section flows well with existing content

## Tips
- Use active voice ("Install Bun" not "Bun should be installed")
- Keep it concise - this is a quick start, not detailed instructions
- Test your commands in a fresh terminal to ensure they're correct
- Use markdown preview in your editor to check formatting
