# Introduction
Eatsential is a LLM-powered platform that connects users to food options with unprecedented precision. By creating a holistic profile that
includes allergies, fitness goals (muscle gain, weight loss, endurance), dietary preferences (vegan, keto), and even mental wellness
objectives (e.g., mood-boosting foods, stress reduction), our system delivers hyper-personalized meal recommendations, recipes, and
restaurant suggestions.

# Slogan
YOUR PLATE, YOUR RULES. PRECISION NUTRITION FOR BODY AND MIND.

# Challenge
In an era of information overload, finding food that truly meets our unique needs is a daily struggle. Consumers with specific dietary requirements—from severe allergies to nuanced fitness goals or mental wellness objectives—are often left navigating a maze of conflicting advice and generic meal plans. This gap leads to frustration, health risks, and the feeling that our food isn't supporting our well-being.
