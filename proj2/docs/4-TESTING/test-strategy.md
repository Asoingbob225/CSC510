## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This System Test Plan (STP) defines the overall testing strategy, approach, and execution plan for the Eatsential Dual-Dimension Health Platform (Physical Health + Mental Wellness). It ensures comprehensive testing coverage across all system components and validates that the system meets specified requirements, including sensitive mental health data handling and AI safety requirements.

### 1.2 Document Scope

This master document provides:

- Overall testing strategy and methodology
- Test level definitions and objectives
- Resource and environment requirements
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Test execution and reporting procedures

### 1.3 Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Shift-Left Testing:** Test early and often in the development cycle
2. **Risk-Based Testing:** Prioritize testing based on risk assessment
3. **Automation First:** Automate repetitive tests for efficiency
4. **Continuous Testing:** Integrate testing into CI/CD pipeline
5. **User-Centric:** Focus on real user scenarios and experiences

```

### 2.2 Testing Methodology

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write tests before code
   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Maintain high unit test coverage

2. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
   - User story based test scenarios
   - Gherkin syntax for acceptance tests
   - Collaboration between QA, Dev, and Product

3. **Continuous Integration Testing**
   - Automated test execution on every commit
   - Fast feedback loop
   - Prevent regression issues

### 2.3 Test Coverage Goals

| Test Level  | Coverage Target | Current Status | Priority |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Unit Tests  | 80%             | 75%            | High     |
| Integration | 70%             | 60%            | High     |
| E2E Tests   | Critical Paths  | In Progress    | Medium   |
| Security    | OWASP Top 10    | Planned        | High     |
| Performance | Load Testing    | Planned        | Medium   |

    password = "SecurePass123!"
    hashed = hash_password(password)
    assert verify_password(password, hashed) == True
    assert verify_password("WrongPass", hashed) == False

# Frontend Unit Test
test('SignupField validates email format', () => {
    const { getByLabelText, getByText } = render(<SignupField />);
    const emailInput = getByLabelText('Email');
    fireEvent.change(emailInput, { target: { value: 'invalid-email' } });
    fireEvent.blur(emailInput);
    expect(getByText('Invalid email address')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

# Test Case: Context-Aware Boosting
