# Governance Model

Our project follows a **meritocratic governance model**:

- **Maintainers**: Core contributors with write access. They review and merge pull requests.
- **Contributors**: Anyone can contribute via issues or pull requests.
- **Decision Making**: Technical decisions are made by consensus among maintainers. In case of disagreement, a majority vote decides.
- **Releases**: Managed by maintainers after passing CI and peer review.
- **Roadmap & Planning**: Discussed publicly via GitHub issues or discussions.

This model ensures transparency, accountability, and community participation in project direction.
