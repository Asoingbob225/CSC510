## 🎯 Next Priority Actions

### Immediate (Today - Batch 1)
Generate these 4 documents together for consistency:

1. **2-SRS/SRS-MASTER.md**
   - Complete IEEE 830 structure
   - Table of contents with links
   - Executive summary

2. **2-SRS/3-specific-requirements/3.4-use-cases.md** ⭐
   - 15-20 detailed use cases
   - Main/Alternate/Exception flows
   - Acceptance criteria for each
   - Mapped to requirements and tests

3. **2-SRS/5-appendices/B-user-personas.md**
   - 4 detailed personas (allergy, fitness, mental health, lifestyle)
   - Background, pain points, goals, scenarios
   - Design implications

4. **2-SRS/3-specific-requirements/3.1-functional-requirements.md**
   - FR-001 to FR-060
   - Organized by module
   - Priority, acceptance criteria, dependencies

### Tomorrow (Batch 2)
5. **2-SRS/3-specific-requirements/3.2-non-functional-requirements.md**
6. **1-SPP/risk-management.md** (CRITICAL for safety)
7. **5-STP/STP-MASTER.md**
8. **5-STP/5.3-system-test-plan/system-test-cases.md**

### Week 2 (Batch 3)
9. **3-DESIGN/3.1-SAD/SAD-MASTER.md**
10. **3-DESIGN/3.1-SAD/architecture-overview.md**
11. **3-DESIGN/3.1-SAD/ai-pipeline-architecture.md**
12. **2-SRS/requirements-traceability-matrix.md**
13. **5-STP/test-traceability-matrix.md**

## 🔑 Key Features of Current Structure

### ✅ Standards Compliance
- **IEEE 830**: SRS structure with 6 main sections
- **IEEE 829**: STP hierarchy (unit/integration/system/acceptance)
- **V-Model**: Clear Requirements ↔ Testing mapping
- **PMBOK**: Comprehensive project management plans

### ✅ Document Organization
- **Numbered phases** (0-7) for clear progression
- **Master documents** for each major deliverable (SPP, SRS, SAD, SDD, STP)
- **Hierarchical structure** matching software lifecycle
- **Subdirectories** for detailed specifications

### ✅ Traceability Support
- Use Cases → System Test Cases
- Requirements → Design → Tests
- Business Needs → Acceptance Tests
- Complete V-Model mapping planned

### ✅ AI Project Specifics
- **RAG architecture** documented separately
- **AI safety testing** (allergen zero-tolerance)
- **Prompt engineering** and LLM integration guides
- **Evaluation metrics** for AI components

## 💡 Tips for Efficient Documentation

### Batch Processing
- Generate related documents together (e.g., all SRS sections)
- Ensures consistency in terminology and cross-references
- Reduces redundancy and conflicts

### Use Provided Structure
- Every directory has a clear purpose
- Follow IEEE standards built into structure
- Master documents provide overview, subdocs provide details

### Maintain Traceability
- Use consistent IDs (FR-001, UC-001, STC-001)
- Cross-reference liberally
- Update traceability matrices weekly

### Version Control
- Commit documents to Git regularly
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Tag major versions (SRS v1.0, etc.)
