# Consistency Review: Sprint Tasks vs Milestones vs Repo Issues

**Review Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Reviewer**: AI Agent  
**Documents Reviewed**:
- `08-SPRINT-TASKS.md` (Sprint 1 tasks)
- `milestones.md` (v0.1-v1.0 roadmap)
- GitHub Issues (#41-#74)

---

## Summary

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Inconsistencies Found

1. **Sprint Tasks out of sync with Milestones**
   - Sprint tasks document shows "Sprint 1 (Oct 19-26)" focusing on v0.1-v0.2 work
   - BUT milestones.md shows v0.1-v0.2 already ‚úÖ Complete
   - Current milestone is v0.3 (40% complete, Mental Wellness tracking)

2. **Sprint Tasks missing Mental Wellness features**
   - Sprint tasks only cover Physical Health (Health Profile, Allergies)
   - NO tasks for Mental Wellness (Mood/Stress/Sleep logging)
   - Milestones v0.3 requires both Physical + Mental features

3. **Completed issues not reflected**
   - Issues #60-#74 are ‚úÖ Closed but sprint tasks show "üî¥ Not Started"
   - Admin features (#67-#74) completed but not in sprint tasks

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Milestone Progress vs Sprint Tasks

#### Milestones.md Status:
```
‚úÖ v0.1 Complete (Auth & Profile)
   - User registration, login, JWT
   - Basic profile management
   - 10 tests, 93% coverage

‚úÖ v0.2 Complete (Health Data Management)
   - Health profile CRUD
   - Allergy management
   - Dietary preferences
   - 34 tests, 88% coverage

üü° v0.3 In Progress (40%) - Tracking System
   - Physical: Meal logging
   - Mental: Mood/Stress/Sleep logging
   - Dashboard (Physical + Mental)
   - Goal tracking
   - 20+ tests planned, >85% target
```

#### Sprint Tasks (08-SPRINT-TASKS.md) Status:
```
Current Sprint: Sprint 1 (Oct 19-26, 2025)
Theme: Authentication & Health Profile Foundation

Completed (5/7 tasks):
‚úÖ FE-S1-001: Password Validation
‚úÖ FE-S1-002: Email Verification UI
‚úÖ BE-S1-001: User Registration API
‚úÖ BE-S1-002: Email Verification System
‚úÖ BE-S1-004: Database Setup

Remaining (2/7 tasks):
üî¥ FE-S1-003: Health Profile Form
üî¥ BE-S1-003: Health Profile CRUD
```

**‚ùå Inconsistency**: Sprint tasks claim v0.2 work is incomplete (FE/BE-S1-003), but milestones show v0.2 ‚úÖ Complete.

---

### 2. GitHub Issues vs Sprint Tasks

#### Completed Issues (v0.2 work):
```
‚úÖ #60: feat(frontend): Implement Health Profile Form (M3)
‚úÖ #61: subtask(backend): Health Profile DB Models and Schemas (M3)
‚úÖ #62: subtask(frontend): Multi-Step Health Profile Wizard UI (M3)
‚úÖ #63: feat(backend): Implement Health Profile CRUD (M3)
```

**‚ùå Inconsistency**: These issues correspond to FE-S1-003 and BE-S1-003, which sprint tasks show as üî¥ Not Started.

#### Admin Features Completed (not in Sprint 1 tasks):
```
‚úÖ #67: feat: Admin Panel Foundation (M3)
‚úÖ #68: feat(frontend): Admin Panel Foundation UI
‚úÖ #69: feat(backend): Admin Role & Protected Routes API
‚úÖ #73: feat: Admin User Management (M3)
‚úÖ #74: feat(frontend): Admin User Management UI (M3)
```

**‚ùå Inconsistency**: Admin features completed but NOT mentioned in Sprint 1 tasks at all.

#### Open Issues (v0.3 work):
```
üìù #70: feat: Admin Data Management for Allergens (M3) - Priority P1
üìù #71: feat(frontend): Implement Data Management UI for Allergens
üìù #72: feat(backend): Implement Data Management API for Allergens
```

**‚úÖ Consistent**: These are correctly open (v0.3 work in progress).

---

### 3. Missing Mental Wellness Tasks

#### Required by Milestones v0.3:
```
Mental Wellness Backend:
- Mental wellness goal API (CRUD)
- Mood logging API (1-10 scale + notes)
- Stress logging API (1-10 + triggers)
- Sleep logging API (duration + quality)
- Data encryption for sensitive fields

Mental Wellness Frontend:
- Wellness goal creation interface
- Quick log widgets (mood emoji, stress slider, sleep)
- Daily dashboard (Physical + Mental)
- Weekly trends view

Testing:
- 20+ unit tests for Mental features
- Integration tests for dashboard
- Encryption verification
```

#### Current Sprint Tasks:
```
‚ùå ZERO Mental Wellness tasks defined
```

**‚ùå Critical Gap**: v0.3 is 40% complete but sprint tasks don't mention Mental Wellness at all.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Update Sprint Tasks Document

**Action**: Replace outdated "Sprint 1" with current v0.3 tasks

**New Structure**:
```markdown
# Sprint Tasks

- Issues: #60, #61, #62, #63 (Health Profile)
- Issues: #67, #68, #69, #73, #74 (Admin Features)

---

### Priority 2: Remove Outdated Content

**Delete**:
- "Sprint 1 (Oct 19-26, 2025)" header - misleading date
- "Theme: Authentication & Health Profile Foundation" - already complete
- Task IDs like "FE-S1-001" - implies Sprint 1 is current
- Detailed code examples (TypeScript/Python) - too verbose for overview doc
- Specific file paths - implementation detail, not planning

**Keep**:
- Issue references (#41-#74)
- Functional requirements and constraints
- Module organization (frontend/backend)
- Definition of Done
- Performance targets

---

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week):
1. ‚úÖ Update `08-SPRINT-TASKS.md` header to reflect v0.3 milestone
2. ‚úÖ Mark v0.1, v0.2 work as complete (reference closed issues)
3. ‚úÖ Add Mental Wellness tasks section
4. ‚úÖ Remove Sprint 1 terminology
5. ‚úÖ Delete code examples and file paths

### Next Steps:
1. Create GitHub issues for Mental Wellness tasks (BE-03-04 to FE-03-05)
2. Assign Mental Wellness tasks to developers
3. Update milestones.md if v0.3 progress changes (currently 40%)
4. Track issue completion and update sprint tasks weekly

---

## Alignment Checklist

After updates, verify:
- [ ] Sprint tasks header shows current milestone (v0.3)
- [ ] Completed issues marked with ‚úÖ and issue numbers
- [ ] All v0.3 work (Physical + Mental) has tasks defined
- [ ] Mental Wellness tasks match milestones.md deliverables
- [ ] Open issues (#70-#72) referenced in sprint tasks
- [ ] No outdated Sprint 1 terminology
- [ ] Task IDs consistent (use milestone-based: FE-03-XX, BE-03-XX)
- [ ] Performance targets aligned (milestones: >85%, sprint: 80%)

---

## Conclusion

**Current State**: Sprint Tasks document is 2-3 weeks out of date.

**Required Action**: Major update to align with:
- Current milestone (v0.3 Tracking System)
- Completed work (v0.1, v0.2, admin features)
- Missing Mental Wellness features (critical gap)

**Estimated Update Time**: 1-2 hours to rewrite sprint tasks document with proper structure and current information.
