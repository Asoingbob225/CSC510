## 6. Inconsistencies & Recommendations

### 6.1 Found Inconsistencies

#### ‚ùå Issue 1: Allergy Tracking Placement (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)

**Initial Concern**: Allergy Management (FR-011) in v0.2, but milestone doc says "Allergy Tracking moved to M5"

**Analysis**:
- v0.2: ‚úÖ Basic allergy **data entry** (CRUD APIs)
- v0.5: ‚úÖ Allergy **filtering in recommendations** (safety logic)

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **No conflict** - Two different aspects of allergy handling
- v0.2: User can input allergies
- v0.5: Recommendations respect allergies

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Keep current design**

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 2: Frontend UI in Milestones

**Concern**: Original milestone doc had "M7: UI & User Experience" separate from backend

**Current Design**: Each milestone includes Backend + Frontend + Tests

**Analysis**: ‚úÖ **Already resolved in latest milestone design**
- v0.1: Auth backend + Auth frontend
- v0.2: Health data backend + Health data frontend
- v0.3: Tracking backend + Tracking frontend + Dashboard
- v0.4: Recommendation backend + Recommendation frontend
- etc.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Correctly designed** - Agile full-stack delivery

---

### 6.2 Recommendations

#### ‚úÖ Recommendation 1: Keep Current Milestone Structure

**Rationale**:
- Milestone design aligns with all 95 FRs
- API development sequence is logical
- Database table dependencies are correct
- Test case distribution is appropriate
- Each milestone delivers end-to-end value

**Action**: ‚úÖ **No changes needed**

---

#### ‚úÖ Recommendation 2: Clarify Allergy Feature Split

**Update milestone doc to explicitly state**:

**v0.2 Allergy Features**:
- Data entry (user can add/edit/delete allergies)
- Severity levels
- Allergen database

**v0.5 Allergy Features**:
- Recommendation filtering (exclude allergens 100%)
- Cross-contamination warnings
- Safety validation (critical testing)

**Action**: Add clarification note in milestones.md

---

#### ‚úÖ Recommendation 3: AI Concierge Decision Point

**Current Design**: v0.7 is Optional

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Correct approach**
- Define clear go/no-go criteria at v0.6 completion
- If timeline tight, skip v0.7 for v1.0 launch
- Can add AI as v1.1 post-launch

**Criteria for v0.7 inclusion**:
- [ ] v0.6 completed on schedule
- [ ] LLM integration budget approved
- [ ] 100% pass rate on medical advice refusal tests achieved
- [ ] User feedback indicates high demand for AI chat
