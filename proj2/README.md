**YOUR PLATE, YOUR RULES. PRECISION NUTRITION FOR BODY AND MIND.**

Eatsential is an LLM-powered platform that connects users to hyper-personalized food options. In a world of information overload, our platform is designed to eliminate the frustration and health risks associated with finding food that truly meets an individual's unique needs. We empower users to take control of their health by providing meal recommendations, recipes, and restaurant suggestions tailored to their holistic profile‚Äîfrom allergies and fitness goals to mental wellness objectives.

---

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Dual-Dimension Health Profile:** We offer support for both physical goals (muscle gain, weight loss) and mental well-being objectives (stress reduction, improved focus).
- **Scientific Nutrition Engine:** Our recommendation system is built on a large nutritional database and a proprietary health-tagging system (e.g., `#PostWorkoutRecovery`, `#StressRelief`) to ensure every suggestion is a perfect nutritional match.
- **AI Health Concierge:** A conversational AI, powered by a cutting-edge LLM, provides users with real-time, human-like support for questions, plan adjustments, or meal insights.
- **Curated Healthy Restaurants:** We partner exclusively with vetted restaurants that use high-quality ingredients and provide transparent nutritional information.
- **Visual Wellness Journey:** Users can track their progress‚Äîfrom calorie intake and weight changes to mood fluctuations‚Äîthrough intuitive charts and timelines.
