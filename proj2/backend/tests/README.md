# Testing Guide for Meal & Goal Tracking

## Quick Start

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd proj2/backend
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Frontend tests  
cd proj2/frontend
bun test --run
```

### Running Specific Test Suites

#### Meal & Goal Tests Only
```bash
cd proj2/backend
python3 -m pytest tests/test_meal_service.py tests/test_goal_service.py \
  tests/routers/test_meals_api.py tests/routers/test_goals_api.py \
  tests/integration/test_meal_goal_integration.py \
  tests/performance/test_meal_goal_performance.py -v
```

#### Unit Tests Only
```bash
pytest tests/test_meal_service.py tests/test_goal_service.py -v
```

#### Integration Tests Only
```bash
pytest tests/routers/test_meals_api.py tests/routers/test_goals_api.py \
  tests/integration/ -v
```

#### Performance Tests Only
```bash
pytest tests/performance/ -v
```

## Test Coverage

### Backend: 111 Tests (100% passing)

**Unit Tests (53 tests)**
- MealService: Full CRUD operations
- GoalService: Full CRUD + progress calculation
- Nutritional calculation
- User data isolation

**Integration Tests (48 tests)**
- All API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Authentication and authorization
- Request/response validation
- Cross-feature workflows

**Performance Tests (10 tests)**
- Response time < 2s for all endpoints
- Bulk data handling
- Concurrent operations

### Frontend: 14 Tests

**Component Tests**
- MealHistory: 3 tests
- QuickMealLogger: 3 tests
- GoalsList: 8 tests

## Key Test Scenarios

### Meal Logging
- ✅ Create meal with single/multiple food items
- ✅ Nutritional calculation (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
- ✅ Update meal with food item replacement
- ✅ Delete meal with cascade to food items
- ✅ Filter by meal type and date range
- ✅ Pagination

### Goal Tracking
- ✅ Create goal (nutrition/wellness types)
- ✅ Update goal status and progress
- ✅ Calculate completion percentage
- ✅ Calculate days remaining
- ✅ Delete goal
- ✅ Filter by type, status, and dates

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Zero calorie meals
- ✅ Partial nutritional data
- ✅ Large target values (10,000+ calories)
- ✅ Decimal precision (1.5 portions, 15.5g protein)
- ✅ Concurrent meal creation
- ✅ Date boundary conditions

### Security
- ✅ Authentication required on all endpoints
- ✅ User data isolation
- ✅ Authorization checks

## Performance Benchmarks

All APIs meet the < 2 second response time requirement:
- Meal creation: < 2s ✅
- Meal list retrieval: < 2s ✅
- Goal creation: < 2s ✅
- Bulk retrieval (50 items): < 2s ✅

## Test Fixtures

Tests use the following fixtures (defined in `conftest.py`):
- `db` - Test database session
- `client` - FastAPI test client
- `auth_headers` - Authentication headers for API calls
- `test_user` - Test user account
- `test_user_2` - Second test user for isolation tests

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:
- No external dependencies required
- In-memory SQLite database
- Fast execution (< 5 seconds total)
- Deterministic results

## Coverage Goals

Current coverage:
- ✅ >85% coverage requirement exceeded
- ✅ 100% coverage for CRUD operations
- ✅ All edge cases covered
- ✅ All performance benchmarks met

- See [TEST_SUMMARY.md](./TEST_SUMMARY.md) for detailed test documentation
- Issue #103 for original requirements
- [Backend API Documentation](../docs/)

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
If tests fail with database errors:
```bash
# Reset test database
cd proj2/backend
rm -f test.db
pytest tests/ --create-db
```

### Import Errors
Ensure dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -e .
pip install pytest pytest-cov httpx
```

### Coverage Report
Generate HTML coverage report:
```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html in browser
```
